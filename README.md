## Overview

Challenge from devchallenges.io to create simple homepage that matches given design using HTML, CSS and JS. Even thou its a simple design, for me - as beginer - it was really challenge and it helped me understand more about responsive design and practice coding.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
